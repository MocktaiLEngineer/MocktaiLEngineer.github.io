# Personal Website

The contents of this repository are dedicated to hosting my personal website. The posts themselves can be found in the _posts directory. To create these posts, I initially write them as Jupyter notebooks in the _jupyter folder. Afterwards, I utilize a formatter and converter script to transform them into markdown files and save them accordingly.

Feel free to visit my website [here](https://mocktailengineer.github.io/)
